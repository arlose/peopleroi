# People detection using motion ROI

[People ROI](https://github.com/sgjava/peopleroi/wiki) compares and contrasts
using image resizing and motion detection to obtain a ROI (region of interest)
versus processing frames and regions unchanged. People detection is used in
this example, but any type of image analysis can benefit from the techniques
contained within.
